## What is SteamLess?

SteamLess is a Windows emulator for Linux. It lets you run Windows games and applications on Linux just like you'd run PlayStation games on a PS2 emulator - except for Windows software.

Powered by Proton (Steam's battle-tested compatibility layer), SteamLess creates isolated Windows environments for each of your apps. You get real C: drives, Windows registries, and the ability to run any Windows .exe file - all managed through an intuitive GUI.

**No Wine required. No Steam required.**

## Key Features

### Run Windows Apps on Linux
  - Install, manage, and launch your Windows apps on Linux, seamlessly.

### Desktop Integration
- **Right-click any .exe** â†’ "Open with SteamLess" â†’ guided setup wizard
- Create desktop shortcuts for your installed Windows apps
- Each app gets its own isolated Windows environment automatically

### No Wine/winetricks Needed
- **Sideload any .exe** directly into your apps via right-click menu
- Need DirectX? Run the actual Microsoft installer. Need .NET? Run the real redistributable.
- Install Windows dependencies just like you would on actual Windows
- No terminal commands, no winetricks scripts, no guessing

### Works With or Without Steam
- **No Steam?** SteamLess auto-installs GE-Proton when you first launch
- **Steam installed?** SteamLess automatically finds Steam's Proton versions for even better compatibility

### Advanced Features
- **Dual-boot save sync** - Seamlessly sync game saves between Windows and Linux with conflict detection
- **Windows version control** - Run apps as Windows XP through Windows 11
- **GameMode & MangoHUD** - Toggle performance optimizations per application
- **Custom Driveletter mapping** - Map any linux folder as a drive inside the windows emu
- **Custom theming** - KDE Plasma and GDK theme auto-fusion plus 4 built-in themes

## Known Limitations

- **Kernel-level anti-cheat games** (Fortnite, Valorant, Battlefield 2042, etc.) won't work. This is a top-level decision by the respective corporations to hard disable Linux in these titles - not a failure of SteamLess.
- **GOG Galaxy**: Has compatibility issues with game installation and launching. **Workaround**: After installing a game through Galaxy, the installed game must be added as a separate app in SteamLess to launch. Additionally, you may need to manually rename the `Dependencies-temp` folder to `Dependencies` in the GOG Galaxy installation directory. **Recommended approach**: Download GOG games as standalone offline installers instead of using the Galaxy client.

## System Requirements

## Why SteamLess Exists

After 26 years on Windows, I switched to Linux and fell in love with finally having control over my system. But running my heavily-modded game library and professional tools (Unity, Blender) through Wine and Lutris was a nightmare.

So I figured out how to use Proton directly, built a GUI for myself, and used it daily for 6+ months. It worked so well I realized other people need this too.

**SteamLess is the tool I built for myself and used every day before deciding to share it.**
