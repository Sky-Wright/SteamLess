## What is SteamLess?

SteamLess is a comprehensive Proton-based Windows application launcher that provides a complete Wine replacement for Linux users. Using Steam's battle-tested Proton compatibility layer, SteamLess enables seamless execution of Windows games and applications directly on Linux without the complexity and maintenance overhead of traditional Wine installations.

**Commercial software with auditable source code** - Full transparency, no telemetry, no mystery binaries.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Launch Windows games and applications** with Proton (Steam's compatibility layer)
- **Works without Steam installed** (Steam installed = access to official Proton builds for even better compatibility)
- **Sideload any .exe into any prefix** - Right-click any app â†’ "Sideload .exe" â†’ run installers, patches, mods, dependencies (DirectX, .NET, VC++ redists), or any Windows executable directly in that app's environment. No winetricks, no terminal commands, no guessing which prefix to use
- **Automatic system setup** - Takes a fresh Linux install and makes it capable of running Windows software - handles all dependencies automatically
- **Universal Linux compatibility** - Extensively tested on Arch Linux, Ubuntu, and Linux Mint - should work on most modern distributions

### Desktop Integration
- **Right-click any .exe** â†’ "Open with SteamLess" â†’ guided setup wizard with dedicated prefix isolation
- Native file associations and MIME types
- Desktop shortcuts

### Advanced Features
- **Dual-boot save file synchronization** with conflict detection and resolution
- **Per-application environment variables** - GPU selection via DRI_PRIME, Vulkan ICD, or any custom vars you need
- **MangoHUD and Gamemode integration** - Toggle on/off per application
- **ISO and disc mounting** with drive letter mapping
- **Custom Windows drive mappings** for complex setups
- **Windows version selection** - XP through 11
- **Custom theming** - KDE Plasma auto-fusion, 4 built-in themes for other DEs

### Battle-Tested Apps
Extensively tested and confirmed working:
- **Game Launchers**: Battle.net, Epic Games Launcher, EA app, GOG Galaxy, Steam
- **Professional Tools**: Blender, Unity, UE5
- **Games**: FFXIV, Guild Wars 2, Black Desert Online, heavily modded Skyrim with Mod Organizer 2
- **And many more**

**Known Limitations**: Kernel-level anti-cheat (Fortnite, Valorant, Battlefield 6, etc...) won't work. This is a top level decision by the respective corporations to hard disable linux in these titles~ not a failure of SteamLess

## Why SteamLess?

After 26 years on Windows, I switched to Linux and fell in love with finally having control over my system. But running my heavily-modded game library and professional tools (Unity, Blender) through Wine and Lutris was a nightmare and some of my projects simply would not port to Linux native.

So I figured out how to use Proton directly with shell scripts, built a simple GUI for myself, and used it daily for 6+ months across two different distros and a GPU upgrade. It worked so well I realized other people need this too.

**SteamLess is the tool I built for myself and used every day before deciding to share it.**

## System Requirements

**For SteamLess itself:**
- Any modern Linux distribution (tested on Arch, Ubuntu, Mint)
- Minimal resources (Python + Tkinter - installer handles dependencies)

**For running Windows apps:**
- Same requirements as Proton/Steam
- Vulkan-compatible GPU recommended
- Actual requirements depend on the Windows software you're running (general rule of thumb is to match the windows requirements at bare minimal)
